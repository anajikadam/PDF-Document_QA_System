Question:  What is Positional Encoding?
Answer  :   Positional encoding is a technique used in deep learning models to provide 
contextual information about the position of an element in a sequence. It is typically 
used in natural language processing tasks such as language translation, question answering, 
and text summarization. Positional encoding is a way to represent the position of an element 
in a sequence as a fixed-length vector, which can be added to the element's embedding to provide 
contextual information. There are many different ways to implement positional encoding, 
including using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, or learned positional embeddings.
